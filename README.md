## Reflection

This is my personal project which I develop in free time to using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.

Originally I wanted to build an application which simulating delivery service.

One of the main challenges tha I am trying to solve now it's sorting and filtrating of data which comes from fake back end.

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router, Redux, Classnames library and Json-server for imitation back end part.
